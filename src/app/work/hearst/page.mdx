## Background

As a Senior Software Engineer at Hearst, I contribute to the development and maintenance of high-traffic digital media platforms across a portfolio of major publications—including [Car and Driver](https://www.caranddriver.com/), [Road & Track](https://www.roadandtrack.com/), and [Autoweek](https://www.autoweek.com/). 

My role involves full-stack web development and UI/UX enhancements, focusing on delivering seamless editorial and consumer experiences. I collaborate daily with cross-functional teams including designers, SEO specialists, ad engineers, and product managers to continuously evolve both the content platform and user engagement tools.
