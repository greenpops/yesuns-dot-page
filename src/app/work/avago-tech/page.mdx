# Projects at Avago Tech (now Broadcom).

## Background
I joined the Automation Team at [Emulex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulex), a company known for its high-performance Fiber Channel network adapters used in enterprise servers from IBM, Dell, and HP.

In February 2015, Emulex was acquired by Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company spun off from Hewlett-Packard. Later that year, Avago merged with Broadcom and adopted the Broadcom name.

Throughout these transitions, I remained part of the engineering team, contributing to large-scale enterprise storage and networking infrastructure.

## Automation Team – Responsibilities and Contributions

### Designed and architected automation frameworks for comprehensive testing of drivers, firmware, and software across multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Solaris, and VMware.
	* Tech stack: Python, Perl, shell, and C++
	* The automation system included:
	  1.	Test launchers – initializing and scheduling test executions
	  2.	Test monitors – real-time tracking of test processes
	  3.	Result logging/reporting – capturing logs, status, and metrics in structured formats
	  4.	Test suites – modular, reusable cases for regression and certification testing

### Key system-level automation components:
	  * Developed device driver installation workflows for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and VMware platforms using Python.
	  * Customized BIOS boot behavior using an internal tool derived from the OpenIPMI open-source project (C++).
	  * Automated system provisioning via PXE boot, Cobbler, Kickstart, and IPMI-based configuration for large-scale test environments.

## VMware Certification Suite & Web-Based Reporting
	  * Led the architecture and development of a VMware ESXi 6.0 (2015) FC/FCoE inbox driver certification suite.
	  * Built comprehensive tooling in Perl for automating test execution, collecting results, and managing compliance across VMware’s certification matrix.
	  * Developed a web-based dashboard to visualize test outcomes and streamline reporting for internal stakeholders and external certification partners.

---
## Mentorship and Team Enablement
	  * Trained QA engineers and interns on using the automation framework for daily regression testing.
	  * Provided guidance on:
		  1. Setting up and executing automated test runs
		  2. Collecting and interpreting log files
		  3. Triage of failures and debugging environment-level issues
