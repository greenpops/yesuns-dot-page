# Projects at Mcgraw-Hill Education

## Background

I joined McGraw-Hill Education as a Software Engineer on the [ALEKS team](https://www.aleks.com/), a widely-used AI-driven adaptive learning platform for K–12 and Higer-Ed students. 

My primary focus was enhancing the student and teacher interfaces, ensuring accessibility compliance, enabling internationalization, and building tools to support cross-functional engineering teams. 

ALEKS was integrated into various institutional platforms, such as Arizona State University’s online learning system, and required seamless interoperability, usability, and reliability for a large and diverse user base.

## Key Contributions

	### Interface Integration & Accessibility
	  - Integrated ALEKS with third-party platforms, such as [Arizona State University’s online learning site](https://math.asu.edu/admission/undergraduate-admission/placement-testing), ensuring consistent user experience and authentication flow.
	  - Led initiatives to make the platform WCAG-compliant, improving accessibility for students with disabilities.
	
  ###	Internationalization & Localization
	  - Developed an internal translation tool to streamline content localization and support global product expansion.
	  - Ensured that the UI components could dynamically switch languages without breaking layout or functionality.

	###	Test Automation & Code Quality
	  - Created and maintained a custom Jasmine unit testing framework tailored to ALEKS’s frontend codebase to ensure quality and stability.
	  - Actively contributed to maintaining high code coverage across key user-facing components.

	###	Agile Development & Cross-Functional Collaboration
	  - Worked in a Scrum-based Agile team, collaborating closely with UX designers, QA engineers, TPMs, and other developers to deliver features in 2-week sprints.
	  -	Participated in planning meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, often taking the lead on UI feature estimations.

	### Mentorship & Onboarding
	  - Mentored interns and junior engineers, guiding them through best practices in responsive UI development for tablets and mobile devices.
	  - Authored and maintained GitLab onboarding documentation using GitLab Wiki to support efficient ramp-up for new team members.
